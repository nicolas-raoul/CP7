## About
The portuguese CP (zip code) is made by a combination of 4 + 3 digits.  
The first 4 digits have a correspondence of an area, normaly equivalent fo the old districts (Freguesias pré 2014), or districts together.
For example, Arroios can be 1000, 1150 or 1170. The Parque das Nações and Moscavide can be 1990 or 1998 :)


All those who start with 1000 are from Lisbon and its surroundings. The last 3 digits indicate
a street or street segment (edge of a block), a point in the middle of that street segment.  
The coordinates of this point that can be extracted, giving a very approximate location of the actual address.  

An aproximation of Lisbon's CP7 is this:
